Inverters are necessary due to the PB inputs on the FPGA being active low.

With Active High Polarity, sw[1] is on:
schematic | VHDL
led[0]/led[4] -> AND therefore on when both buttons pushed
led[1]/led[5] -> NAND therefore on when not pushing both buttons
led[2]/led[6] -> OR therefore on when one or both pushed
led[3]/led[7] -> XOR therefore on when one button is pushed

With Active Low Polarity, sw[1] is off:
schematic | VHDL
led[0]/led[4] -> NAND therefore on when not pushing both buttons
led[1]/led[5] -> AND therefore on when both buttons pushed
led[2]/led[6] -> NOR therefore on when no buttons pushed
led[3]/led[7] -> XNOR therefore on when inputs are the same 00 or 11
